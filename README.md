## Team Caesar â€“ Home Loan Default Risk Prediction 
  
  
### Project Description:
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. 

Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by supplying a positive and safe borrowing experience. To make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
